# Advanced SQL Practice Portfolio

This repository contains my SQL practice as I prepare for Data Engineering and Analytics roles.  
I use it to work through real interview questions, improve my SQL fluency, and keep track of my progress.  
The focus is on writing clean, readable SQL that solves practical analytical problems.

## What This Repository Covers

The SQL examples here include:

### Window Functions

- ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK
- Ordered calculations using SUM() OVER and AVG() OVER
- Running totals and partitioned analytics

### Top-N and Ranking Logic

- Most recent entries per customer or category
- Top N values per group
- Nth record problems

### Aggregation and Grouping

- Standard GROUP BY queries
- Aggregate summaries and comparisons

### Conditional Aggregation

- MAX(CASE WHEN…) patterns
- Extracting specific rows after windowing
- Combining aggregated and row-level logic

### Multi-step CTE Workflows

- Layered CTEs to build analytical datasets
- Mixing window functions, joins, and aggregation
- Realistic transformations similar to BI and Data Engineering tasks

### Recursive CTEs

- Parent–child hierarchies
- Multi-level organizational or category structures

### Pattern Recognition

- LAG/LEAD analysis
- Detecting consecutive values and streaks
- Session-based logic

Each folder contains SQL files with:

- A short description of the problem
- The SQL solution, formatted clearly
- Notes when needed

## Purpose of This Repository

I created this repository to:

- Practice SQL consistently
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Improve my ability to structure analytical queries
- Demonstrate the way I approach data problems
- Keep track of examples I can refer back to

I update it regularly as I work through more exercises and interview-style questions.

## Notes

This is an ongoing project.  
I’ll continue adding new problems, solutions, and improvements as I move forward in my learning and interview preparation.
